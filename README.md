# Simple-User-Editor

This is a working version that currently has no custom styling, no adding or deleting users and no search function.
It does have JSON reading and parsing, creating models from data parsed from JSON and displaying them in the GUI, as well as interactions between some GUI Widgets such as
displaying detailed data on the user selected in the brief user list, as well as displaying their image if they have one.
It also includes a simple JSON file that contains some of the sample data that's supposed to be displayed in the application.
